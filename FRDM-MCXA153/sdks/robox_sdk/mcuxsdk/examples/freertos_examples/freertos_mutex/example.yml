      brief: This document explains the freertos_mutex example. It shows how mutex
        manage access to commonresource (terminal output).The example application
        creates two identical instances of write_task. Each task will lock the mutexbefore
        printing and unlock it after printing to ensure that the outputs from tasks
        are not mixedtogether.The test_task accept output message during creation
        as function parameter. Output message have twoparts. If xMutex is unlocked,
        the write_task_1 acquire xMutex and print first part of message. Thenrescheduling
        is performed. In this moment scheduler check if some other task could run,
        but secondtask write_task+_2 is blocked because xMutex is already locked by
        first write task. The firstwrite_task_1 continue from last point by printing
        of second message part. Finaly the xMutex isunlocked and second instance of
        write_task_2 is executed.
