      brief: 'The lpspi_int_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI CMSIS driver
        in interrupt way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI
        master and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file ''cmsis_lpspi_int_b2b_transfer_slave.c''
        includes the LPSPI slave code.This example uses the transactional API in LPSPI
        driver.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt
        . '
