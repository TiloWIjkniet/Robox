      brief: 'The cmsis_lpspi_int_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI CMSIS
        driver in interrupt way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used
        as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file ''cmsis_lpspi_int_b2b_transfer_master.c''
        includes the LPSPI master code.This example uses the transactional API in
        LPSPI driver.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt
        . '
