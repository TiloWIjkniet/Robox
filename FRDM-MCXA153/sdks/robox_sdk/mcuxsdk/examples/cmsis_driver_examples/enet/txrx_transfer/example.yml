      brief: "CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware\
        \ making it reusable across a wide \nrange of supported microcontroller devices.\
        \ The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware \nthat implements\
        \ for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.\
        \ \nMore information and usage method please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.\n\
        \nThe cmsis_enet_transfer example shows how to use CMSIS ENET driver:\n\n\
        In this example, the ENET transmits 20 number broadcast frames and will print\
        \ the received frame.\n\n"
