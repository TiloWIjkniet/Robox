      brief: CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use CMSIS spi
        driver as master to do board to board transfer with interrupt:In this example,
        one spi instance as master and another spi instance on the other board as
        slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data
        from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
