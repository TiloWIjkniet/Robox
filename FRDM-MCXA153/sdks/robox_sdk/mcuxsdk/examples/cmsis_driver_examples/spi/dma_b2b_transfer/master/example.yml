      brief: 'The spi_dma_b2b_transfer example shows how to use SPI CMSIS driver in
        dma way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as SPI master
        and another board used as SPI slave.The file ''spi_dma_b2b_transfer_master.c''
        includes the SPI master code.1. SPI master send/received data to/from SPI
        slave in dma . '
