      brief: FreeMASTER example fully configured by MCUXpresso ConfigTools. Serial
        communication is used by default, but it can be changed easily to CAN or other
        in the MCUXpresso Peripheral Tool. Also FreeMASTER driver features are configured
        graphically in this tool. The Pins and Clock Tool are used to configure pin
        multiplexers and clocks. Just like other FreeMASTER examples, the application
        demonstrates use of FreeMASTER tool to visualize internal variables and to
        control the application flow by modifying variables. The application also
        shows use of advanced FreeMASTER features like TSA tables and Pipes.
