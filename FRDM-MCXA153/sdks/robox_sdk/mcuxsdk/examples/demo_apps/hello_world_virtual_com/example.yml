      brief: Hello World Virtual Com demonstrates the use of virtual com to print
        the "Hello World" string to the terminal. Different with Hello World demo
        (a HW UART peripheral is used to transmit data), the demo transmits data based
        on a serial port simulated by the USB device stack on target board side via
        USB peripheral. The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how to use virtual
        com and provide a simple project for debugging and further development.
