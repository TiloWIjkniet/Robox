      brief: 'In this demo, A core decoded music data and put it to DDR buffer and
        informs M core with the related information. Then M core will take the ownership
        of consuming the buffer, it will copy buffer from DDR to TCM, manipulating
        SDMA to transfer the data to SAI and codec for playback. It gives DDR and
        A core opportunity to do power saving for rather long time frame. M core will
        also take ownership of codec initialization. SRTM(Simplified Real Time Messaging)
        protocol is used to communicate between A core an M4 core. '
