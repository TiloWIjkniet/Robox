        record and playback at same time.2. Playback a 250 Hz sine wave data generated
        by CMSIS-DSP library. Also compute the fundamental frequency using Fast Fourier
        Transform with CMSIS-DSP library.3. Record a 5 seconds audio to sdcard with
        a FatFs system. After record, playback it. This feature may only existed in
        platform which support sdhc.
