      brief: The bubble level demo demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer
        to implement a bubble level. A bubble level utilizes two axes to visually
        show deviation from a level plane (0 degrees) on a given axis. You can open
        the mex file with MCUXpresso Config Tool to do further configuration of pin,
        clock and peripheral.
