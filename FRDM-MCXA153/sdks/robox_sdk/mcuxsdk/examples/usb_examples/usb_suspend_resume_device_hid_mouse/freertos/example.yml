      brief: the application is enumerated as a mouse. When host releases the USB
        Bus, the device will enter into low power mode. The device can be waked up
        when resume signal is detected on the bus. Or the device can remote wake-up
        the host by delivering the resume signal when the remote wake-up is enabled
        by the host.
