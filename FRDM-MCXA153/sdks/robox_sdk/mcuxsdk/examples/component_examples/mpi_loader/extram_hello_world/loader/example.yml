      brief: The mpi_loader_extram_hello_world_loader application provides an example
        of a small loader running in SoC internal memory, which is able to initialize
        the external RAM controller and load the other application to external memory
        and kick off it. The loader itself is built to run in internal memory, and
        the application to be loaded is built to run in external RAM. They are combined
        with elftosb tool. On system reset, ROM loads them as a single image into
        SoC internal memory, and starts the loader. Then the loader will load the
        secondary application and kick off it to run in external memory. The elftosb
        and blhost tool can be downloaded from nxp.com.
