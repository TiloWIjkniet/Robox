      brief: The I2S example project uses one I2S interface to continuously record
        input sound to a bufferand another I2S interface to playback the buffer to
        output - digital loopback.It requires NXP Mic/Audio/Oled Shield with WM8904
        codec.It needs to have 1-2 connected on JP3.
