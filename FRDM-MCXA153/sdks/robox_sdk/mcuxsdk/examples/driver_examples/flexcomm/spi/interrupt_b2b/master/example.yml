      brief: The spi_interrupt_b2b_master example shows how to use spi functional
        API to do interrupt transfer as a master:In this example, the spi instance
        as master. Master sends a piece of data to slave, receive data from slave,and
        checkif the data master received is correct. This example needs to work with
        spi_interrupt_b2b_slave example.
