      brief: The spi_dma_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver as
        slave to do board to board transfer with DMA:In this example, one spi instance
        as slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master sends a
        piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received from master is correct.
