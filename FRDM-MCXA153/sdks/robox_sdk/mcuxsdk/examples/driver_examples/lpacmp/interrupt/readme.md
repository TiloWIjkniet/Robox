# lpacmp_interrupt

## Overview

The lpacmp_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with lpacmp driver.

The lpacmp_interrupt example illustrates how to use interrupts in the lpacmp
driver. In this example, the user should specify a channel that provides the voltage signal
which can be controlled by the user as a sample input to lpacmp. When running the project,
typing any key in the debug console will start the comparison. The interrupt occurs when the
value of we check is higher than the reference value.
