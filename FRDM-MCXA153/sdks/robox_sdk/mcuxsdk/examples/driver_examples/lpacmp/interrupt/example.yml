      brief: The lpacmp_interrupt example illustrates how to use interrupts in the
        lpacmp driver. In this example, the user should specify a channel that provides
        the voltage signal which can be controlled by the user as a sample input to
        lpacmp. When running the project, typing any key in the debug console will
        start the comparison. The interrupt occurs when the value of we check is higher
        than the reference value.
