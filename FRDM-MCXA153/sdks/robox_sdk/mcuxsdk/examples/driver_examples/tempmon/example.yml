      brief: The TEMPMON project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TEMPMON
        driver.The temperatue monitor (TEMPMON) module features alarm functions that
        can raise independent interrupt signals if the temperature is above two high-temperature
        thresholds and below a low temperature threshold, the system can then use
        this module to monitor the on-die temperature and take appropriate actions
        such as throttling back the core frequency when a the high temperature interrupt
        is set.
