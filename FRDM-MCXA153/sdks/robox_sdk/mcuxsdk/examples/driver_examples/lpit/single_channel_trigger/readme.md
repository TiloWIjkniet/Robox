# lpit_single_channel_trigger

## Overview
The LPIT single channel trigger project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the LPIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the serial terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.

## Running the demo
When the example runs successfully, you can see an LED is toggled on the board and see the similar information from the terminal as below.
