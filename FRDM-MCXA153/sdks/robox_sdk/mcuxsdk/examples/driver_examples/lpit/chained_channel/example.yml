      brief: The LPIT chained channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT
        driver. It sets up the LPIT hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt
        after every 1 second in the channel No.0, the channel No.1 chained with channel
        No.0, if LPIT contain more than two channels, the channel No.2 chained with
        channel No.1....the channel No.N chained with Channel No.N-1. When the LPIT
        interrupt is triggered.
