      brief: 'The spi_dma_transfer_slave example shows how to use driver API to transfer
        in DMA way.  In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance
        on the other board as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive
        a piece of data from slave. This example checksif the data received from slave
        is correct. This example needs to work with spi_dma_transfer_master example. '
