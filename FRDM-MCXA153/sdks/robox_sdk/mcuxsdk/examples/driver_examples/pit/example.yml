      brief: The PIT project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PIT driver.
        It sets up the PIT hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every
        1 second. When the PIT interrupt is triggered, a message will be printed on
        the UART terminal and an LED be toggled on the board.
