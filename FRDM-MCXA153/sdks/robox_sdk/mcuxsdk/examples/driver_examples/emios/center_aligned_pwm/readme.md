# emios_center_aligned_pwm

## Overview

The eMIOS project is a simple demonstration example of the SDK eMIOS driver to use eMIOS as PWM generator.  
It configures eMIOS UC (Unified channel) as Center Aligned Output PWM with Dead Time Insertion Buffered (OPWMCB) mode.  
This example generates three 10kHz center aligned PWM, there duty cycle are 50%, 25% and 12.5%.
