      brief: The adc_software_trigger example shows how to software trigger ADC conversion.
        In this example, ADC resolution is set as 16bit, the reference voltage is
        selected as the internal 1.8V bandgap, and input gain is set as 1. So the
        input voltage range is from 0 to 1.8V. Users can trigger ADC conversion by
        press any key in the terminal. ADC interrupt will be asserted once the conversion
        is completed.
