      brief: The flexcan_remote_request example shows how to use remote request feature
        by SDK driver. In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Board
        A send a remote frame to request message from board B. After successful request,
        board A will receive response message with same mailbox as transmit mailbox.
        Board B receive remote frame and send response message automatically, but
        do not save remote frame. After successful response, board B will increase
        response message and wait for next remote request.
