      brief: flexcan_efifo_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use FlexCAN Enhanced
        Rx FIFO in none-blocking interrupt way:In this example, when set ENABLE_LOOPBACK
        macro, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
        Buffer to Tx Message Buffer and setup Enhanced Rx FIFO. After that, the example
        will send 4 CAN FD Messages from Tx Message Buffer to Enhanced Rx FIFO through
        internal loopback interconnect. The send and received message will be print
        out to terminal When not define ENABLE_LOOPBACK, need 2 boards are connected
        through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to Endpoint B(board
        B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receive the message by
        Enhanced Rx FIFO, and print the message content to terminal after receive
        4 CAN FD messages.
