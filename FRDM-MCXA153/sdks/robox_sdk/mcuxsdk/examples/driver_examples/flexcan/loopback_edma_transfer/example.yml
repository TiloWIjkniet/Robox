      brief: The flexcan_loopback_edma example shows how to use the EDMA version transactional
        driver to receiveCAN Message from Rx FIFO:To demonstrates this example, only
        one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN MessageBuffer to
        Tx Message Buffer and also setup Rx FIFO. After that, the example will send
        4 CAN Messagesfrom Tx Message Buffer to Rx FIFO through internal loopback
        interconnect and read them out usingEDMA version FlexCAN transactional driver.
        The Sent and received message will be print out to terminalat last.
