      brief: The flexio_spi_slave_dynamic example shows how to use flexio spi slave
        driver in edma way, In this example, a flexio simulated slave connect to a
        lpspi master. The CS signal remains low during transfer, after master finishes
        the transfer and re-asserts the CS signal, interrupt is triggered to let user
        know.
