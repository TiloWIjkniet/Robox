      brief: The RTC project is a demonstration program of the SDK RTC driver working
        on time date mode. The program sets the time and date, watchdog and tamper.
        3 alarms are enabled, alarm0 is single shot, alarm1 and alarm2 are repeated.
        In the alarm interrupt handler, the watchdog is fed. When a tamper occurs,
        the system will be reset, the time stamp of tamper will log out and the prestore
        security key will be erased and log out.
