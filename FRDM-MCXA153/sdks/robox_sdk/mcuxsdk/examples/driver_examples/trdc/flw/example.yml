      brief: The trdc flw example shows how to use the trdc flash logical window funtion.
        In this example, flash logical window is configured and enabled. First memory
        outside the window is touched and the hardfault occurs, then enlarge the window
        size to make the access legal. Next the data mapping between the physical
        address and programmable flash address is checked.
