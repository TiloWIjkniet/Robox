      brief: The dac_basic example shows how to use DAC module to generate sinewave.
        The user can specify the sinewave frequency and how many output points in
        one cycle of the sinewave. Based on these two parameters and the functional
        clock frequency of ctimer, we can calculate how long each interval enters
        the ctimer interrupt. Note that if the device does not have an FPU, then running
        the example directly may get bad performance, and the user can add an array,
        the elements of the array are the input values corresponding to the DAC output
        voltage values for one sinewave cycle.
