      brief: The WKT project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK WKT driver.
        It sets up the WKT hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after loading
        a counter value and counting down to 0. When the WKT interrupt is triggered
        a message printed on the UART terminal and the LED is toggled on the board.Depending
        on the clock source, the WKT can be used for waking up the part from any low
        power mode or for general-purposetiming.
