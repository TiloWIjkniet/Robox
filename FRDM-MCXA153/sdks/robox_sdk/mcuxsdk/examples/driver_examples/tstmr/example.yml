      brief: The tstmr example shows the usage of TSTMR driver in application. The
        TSTMR module is a free running incrementing counter that starts running after
        system reset de-assertion and can be read at any time by the software for
        determining the software ticks.The TSTMR runs off the 1 MHz clock and resets
        on every system reset.In this example, it would output a time stamp information
        when the application is ready. And then, delay for 1 second with TSTMR_DelayUs()
        function. Before and after the delay, it would output the two time stamps
        information again.
