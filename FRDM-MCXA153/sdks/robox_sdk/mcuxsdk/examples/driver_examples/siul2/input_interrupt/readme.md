# siul2_input_interrupt

## Overview
The siul2 Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs.
The example is supported by the set, clear, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. The 
example uses the software button to control/toggle the LED.
