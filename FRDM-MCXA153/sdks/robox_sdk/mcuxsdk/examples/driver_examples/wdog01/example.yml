      brief: The WDOG Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog driver.In
        this example,implemented to test the wdog.And then after 10 times of refreshing
        the watchdog, a timeout reset is generated.We also try to refresh out of window
        to trigger reset after 10 times of refreshing.Please notice that because WDOG
        control registers are write-once only, so the WDOG_Init function and the WDOG_Disable
        function can be called only once after reset.
