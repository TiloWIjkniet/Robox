# i2c_read_fxls89xx_accel_value_transfer

## Overview
The i2c_read_fxls89xx_accel_value example shows how to use LPC I2C driver to communicate with an lpc_i2c device:

 1. How to use the lpc_i2c driver to read a lpc_i2c device who_am_I register.
 2. How to use the lpc_i2c driver to write/read the device registers.

In this example, the values of three-axis accelerometer print to the serial terminal on PC through
the virtual serial port on board.
