      brief: 'The QTMR project is a demonstration program of the SDK QTMR driver''s
        input capture and output pwm feature.The example sets up a QTMR channel for
        input capture. Once the input signal is received,this example will enter interrupt
        and print the capture value.The example also sets up one QTMR channel to output
        pwm. The user should probe a 50Khz PWM signal output with50% dutycycle with
        a oscilloscope. '
