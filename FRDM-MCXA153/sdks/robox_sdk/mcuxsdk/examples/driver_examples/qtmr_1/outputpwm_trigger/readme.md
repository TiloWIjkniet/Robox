# qtmr_inputcapture_outputpwm

## Overview

The QTMR project is a demonstration program of the SDK QTMR driver's input capture and output pwm feature.
The example sets up a QTMR channel for input capture. Once the input signal is received, the example will print
the capture frequency value while the check is interrupted and waiting for the capture frequency to stabilize.
The example also sets up one QTMR channel to output pwm. The user should probe a 50Khz PWM signal output with
50% dutycycle with a oscilloscope.
