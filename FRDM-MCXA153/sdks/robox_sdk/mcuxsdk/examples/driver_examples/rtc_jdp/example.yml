      brief: The RTC example is a simple demonstration program of the SDK RTC driver.
        The RTC interrupt is enabled in period 1000ms, the API(Autonomous Periodic
        Interrupt) interrupt is enabled in 500ms. A callback function sample is provided
        which will log it is a RTC or API interrupt and toggle the corresponding LED
        if existed in the board.
