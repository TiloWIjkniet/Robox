      brief: The aon_lpadc_edma example shows how to use ADC to trigger a DMA transfer.
        In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal(can
        be controlled by user) as the aon_lpadc's sample input. A programmable watermark
        threshold supports configurable notification of data availability. When FCTRLn[FCOUNT]
        is greater than FCTRLn[FWMARK], the associated RDY flag is asserted which
        would generate a eDMA request and trigger the eDMA to move the ADC conversion
        result from ADC result FIFO to user indicated memory. Then the major loop
        waits for the transfer to be done. The results would be printed on terminal
        when any key pressed.
