      brief: The PowerQuad fetches data from system RAM and private RAM through different
        path, for the calcutations which need data from two parts of memory, such
        as FIR, convolve, correlate, and some matrix operations, place the input data
        B in private RAM improves the performance. PowerQuad private RAM starts from
        address 0xe0000000, the first 4KByte is used by PowerQuad driver, the RAM
        starts from 0xe0001000 could be used by user for optimization. In this example,
        the FIR taps, convolve input data B, and correlate input data B are not changed,
        so they are converted to float format and saved to private RAM at the beginning.
        If the example runs successfully, the performance using optimized method is
        better than the nornal method.
