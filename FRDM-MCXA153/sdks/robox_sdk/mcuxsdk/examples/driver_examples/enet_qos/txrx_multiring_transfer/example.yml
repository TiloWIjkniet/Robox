      brief: The example shows the way to use ENET QOS driver to receive and transmit
        frames supported multi-ring platforms. this example is only supported in multi-ring
        platform. 1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET MAC. 2. How to
        use ENET MAC to transmit frames in avb supported multiple-ring platforms.
        The example transmits 20 number frames. For simple demo, we create frames
        with some special definition. 1. Build transmission frames with broadcast
        mac address. 2. Build frames with unicast mac address 3. Send broadcast frames
        to ring 0 and unitcase frames to ring 1, then receive them back in associated
        rings.
