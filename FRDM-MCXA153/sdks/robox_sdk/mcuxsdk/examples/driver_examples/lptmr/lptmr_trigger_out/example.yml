      brief: The LPTMR project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK LPTMR
        driver. It sets up the LPTMRhardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt
        after every 1 second. When the LPTMR interrupt is triggereda message a printed
        on the UART terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.
