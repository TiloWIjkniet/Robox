      brief: This example shows how to use CTimer to trigger DMA transfer by match
        feature. DMA requests are generated when the value of Timer Counter (TC) matches
        match register. In this example, CTimer match event occurs every 1 second
        and then trigger DMA transfer. After DMA transfer two times, that is 2 seconds
        later, CTimer counter stops and DMA will not be triggered. This example do
        not generate external outputs.
