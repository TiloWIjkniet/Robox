      brief: The Simple Match Interrupt project is to demonstrate usage of the SDK
        CTimer driver with interrupt callback functionsIn this example the upon match
        and IO pin connected to the LED is toggled and the timer is reset, so it would
        generate a square wave.With an interrupt callback the match value is changed
        frequently in such a way that the frequency of the output square wave is increased
        gradually.
