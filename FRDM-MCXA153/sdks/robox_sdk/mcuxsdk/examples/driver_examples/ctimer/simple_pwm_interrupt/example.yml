      brief: The Simple PWM Interrupt project is to demonstrate usage of the SDK CTimer
        driver as a PWM with interrupt callback functionsIn this example an IO pin
        connected to the LED is used as a PWM output line to generate a PWM signal.With
        an interrupt callback the PWM duty cycle is changed frequently in such a way
        that the LED brightness can be varied.
