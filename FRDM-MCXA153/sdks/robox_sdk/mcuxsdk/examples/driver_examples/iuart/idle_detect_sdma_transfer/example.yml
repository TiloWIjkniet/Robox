      brief: The uart_idle_detect_sdma example shows how to use uart driver in sdma
        way:In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board
        willsend back all characters that PC send to the board.Uart will receive 8
        characters every time, but if the character is less then 8, the idleline interrupt
        will generate, and abort the SDMA receive operation, and send out the receivedcharacters.
