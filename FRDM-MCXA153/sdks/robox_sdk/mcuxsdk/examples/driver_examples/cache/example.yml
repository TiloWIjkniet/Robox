      brief: The cache example shows how to use memory cache driver.In this example,
        many memory (such as SDRAM, etc) and DMA will be used to show the example.Those
        memory is both accessible for cpu and DMA. For the memory data alignment,
        cache driver should be used rightly. For cache enabled case, the cache invalidate
        operation should be done before cpu access the memory. The cache clean opeartion
        should be done after CPU verify the memorymemory and before DMA access the
        memory.
