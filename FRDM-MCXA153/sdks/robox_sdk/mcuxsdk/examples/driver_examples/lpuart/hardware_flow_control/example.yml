      brief: The lpuart_hardware_flow_control Example project is to demonstrate usage
        of the hardware flow control function.This example will send data to itself(loopback),
        and hardware flow control will be enabled in the example.The CTS(clear-to-send)
        pin is for transmiter to check if receiver is ready, if the CTS pin is assert,
        transmiter startto send data. The RTS(request-to-send) is a pin for receiver
        to inform the transmiter if receiver is ready to receivedata. So, please connect
        RTS to CTS pin directly.
