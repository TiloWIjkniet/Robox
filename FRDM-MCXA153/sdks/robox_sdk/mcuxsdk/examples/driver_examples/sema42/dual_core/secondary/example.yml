      brief: The sema42 example shows how to use SEMA42 driver to lock and unlock
        a sema gate:In this example:1. Firstly, Core 0 turn on LED  and lock a sema
        gate then boot up Core 1 wake up.2. Core 1 must be wait until Core 0 unlocks
        this sema gate to lock it.3. After user press any key in terminal window,
        the sema gate will be unlocked by core 0,then core 1 will lock it and turn
        off the LEDIf the board does not have LED to show the status, then core 1
