      brief: The LPCMP round robin example is a simple demonstration program to use
        the LPCMP driver and help user with a quick start.In this example, user needs
        to specify which port and channel to fixed, users also need to specify one
        or more checker channels. Before doing the comparison, it is necessary to
        preset the comparison result of each checker channel with the fixed channel.
        Change the input voltage of checker channels, if the output results of the
        comparator is different from the preset value, an interrupt will be triggered,
        and the triggered channel's information will be printed on the terminal.
