      brief: This example tests the Blit Engine by running G2D operations. g2d_basic_test.c
        creates pixel buffers and specifies the operation to be performed. Each call
        to g2d_blit() triggers the Blit Engine to process the pixels and place the
        result in the destination pixel buffer.
