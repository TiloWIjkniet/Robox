      brief: The primary core writes a value to the secondary core mailbox, it causes
        mailbox interrupt on the secondary core side. The secondary core reads the
        value from mailbox, it increments and writes it to mailbox register for the
        primary core, which causes mailbox interrupt on the primary core side. The
        primary core reads value from mailbox, it increments and writes it to the
        mailbox register for the secondary core again.
