      brief: The DMA hardware trigger example is a simple demonstration program that
        uses the SDK software.It executes one shot transfer from source buffer to
        destination buffer using the SDK DMA drivers by hardware trigger.The purpose
        of this example is to show how to use the DMA and to provide a simple example
        fordebugging and further development.
