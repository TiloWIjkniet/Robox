      brief: The DMA memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program that
        uses the SDK software.It executes one shot polling transfer from source buffer
        to destination buffer using the SDK DMA drivers.The purpose of this example
        is to show how to use the DMA and to provide a simple example for debugging
        and further development.
