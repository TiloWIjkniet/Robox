      brief: The lpadc_temperature_measurement example shows how to measure the temperature
        within the internal sensor. In this example, the ADC input channel is mapped
        to an internal temperature sensor. When running the project, typing any key
        into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC watermark interrupt would
        be asserted once the number of datawords stored in the ADC Result FIFO is
        greater than watermark value. In ADC ISR, the watermark flag would be cleared
        by reading the conversion result value. When the conversion done, two valid
        result will be put in the FIFO, then the temperature can be calculated within
        the two results and a specific formula.
