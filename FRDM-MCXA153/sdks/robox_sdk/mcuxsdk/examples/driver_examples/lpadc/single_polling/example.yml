      brief: The lpadc_single_polling example shows the simplest way to use LPADC
        driver.In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage
        signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC'ssample input. When running
        the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion.
        The execution would check the FIFO valid flag in loop until the flag is asserted,
        which means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value
        and print it to debug console.Note, the default setting of initialization
        for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can changethe
        configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.
