      brief: The lpadc_single_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with LPADC
        driver.In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage
        signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC'ssample input. When running
        the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion.
        ADC watermark interrupt would be asserted once the number of datawords stored
        in the ADC Result FIFO is greater than watermark value.In ADC ISR, the watermark
        flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, result
        information wouldbe printed when the execution return to the main function.
