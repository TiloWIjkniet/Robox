      brief: This driver example should demonstrate how to setup BEE driver for on
        the fly decryption of data stored in QSPI memory region. The BEE is configuerd
        to decrypt all data starting from location 0x6000_0000 to 0x6001_0000 using
        AES ECB mode with user specified key. If the BEE_KEY_SEL fuse is programmed,
        then OTPMK key will be used instead.The example itself does not perform any
        data decryption operation over QSPI. It is used only as a BEE setup guide.
