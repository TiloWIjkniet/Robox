      brief: The EDMA4 memory to memory transfer example is a simple demonstration
        program that uses the SDK software.It executes one shot transfer from source
        buffer to destination buffer using the SDK EDMA4 drivers.The purpose of this
        example is to show how to use the EDMA4 and to provide a simple example for
        debugging and further development.
