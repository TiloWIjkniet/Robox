      brief: The EDMA4 memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program
        that uses the SDK software.It executes one shot transfer from source buffer
        to destination buffer using the SDK EDMA4 drivers.The purpose of this example
        is to show how to use the EDMA4 and to provide a simple example for debugging
        and further development.
