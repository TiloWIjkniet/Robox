      brief: The i3c_edma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i3c driver
        as slave to do board to board transfer with EDMA. In this example, one i3c
        instance as master and another i3c instance on the other board as slave. Master
        sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This
        example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
