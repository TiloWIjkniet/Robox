      brief: The Multicore NETC PSI-VSI demo application demonstrates how to set up
        projects for individual cores on a multicore system. In this demo, the primary
        core use NETC PSI to send/receive frames. It also releases the secondary core
        from the reset. The secondary core toggles an on-board LED indicating that
        the secondary core is running and uses NETC VSI to send/receive frames.
