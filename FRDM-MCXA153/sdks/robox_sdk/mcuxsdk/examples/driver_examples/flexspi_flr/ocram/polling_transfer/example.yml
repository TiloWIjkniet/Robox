      brief: The flexspi_flr_ocram_polling_transfer example shows how to use the spi
        leader to access the OCRAM via the spi follower. In this example, FlexSPI
        and FlexSPI Follower are both enabled. The FlexSPI will read and write the
        internal OCRAM controlled by FlexSPI Follower. During this process, FlexSPI
        will send a mailbox to the FlexSPI follower to trigger an interrupt.
