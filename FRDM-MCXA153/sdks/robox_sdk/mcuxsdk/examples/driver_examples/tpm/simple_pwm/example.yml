      brief: The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver.
        It sets up the TPMhardware block to output a center-aligned PWM signal. The
        PWM dutycycle is manually updated.On boards that have an LED connected to
        the TPM pins, the user will see a change in LEDbrightness if user enter different
        values.
