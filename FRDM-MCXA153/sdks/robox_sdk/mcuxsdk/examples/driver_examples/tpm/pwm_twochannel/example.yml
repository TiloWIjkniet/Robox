      brief: The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver.
        It sets up the TPMhardware block to output PWM signals on two TPM channels.
        The PWM dutycycle on both channelsis manually updated. On boards that have
        an LED connected to the TPM pins, the user will seea change in LED brightness
        if user enter different values.
