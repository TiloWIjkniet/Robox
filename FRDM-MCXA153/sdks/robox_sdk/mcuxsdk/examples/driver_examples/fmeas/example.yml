      brief: This example shows how to use SDK drivers to use the Frequency Measure
        feature of SYSCON module on LPC devices.It shows how to measure a target frequency
        using a (faster) reference frequency. The example uses the internal main clock
        as the reference frequency to measure the frequencies of the RTC, watchdog
        oscillator, and internal RC oscillator.
