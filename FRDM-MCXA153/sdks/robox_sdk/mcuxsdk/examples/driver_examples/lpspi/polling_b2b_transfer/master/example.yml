      brief: The lpspi_polling_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI driver
        in polling way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI
        master and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file 'lpspi_polling_b2b_transfer_master.c'
        includes the LPSPI master code.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from
        LPSPI slave in polling . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the
        data)
