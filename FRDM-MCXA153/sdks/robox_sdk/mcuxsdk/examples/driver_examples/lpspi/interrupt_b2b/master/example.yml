      brief: The lpspi_interrupt_b2b example shows how to use LPSPI driver in interrupt
        way:In this example , we need two boards , one board used as LPSPI master
        and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file 'lpspi_interrupt_b2b_master.c'
        includes the LPSPI master code.This example does not use the transactional
        API in LPSPI driver. It's a demonstration that how to use the interrupt in
        KSDK driver.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt
        . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)
