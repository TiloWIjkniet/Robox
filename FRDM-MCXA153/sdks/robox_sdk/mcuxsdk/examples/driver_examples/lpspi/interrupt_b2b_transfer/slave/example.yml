      brief: The lpspi_interrupt_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI driver
        in interrupt way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI
        master and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file 'lpspi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave.c'
        includes the LPSPI slave code.This example uses the transactional API in LPSPI
        driver.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt
        . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)
