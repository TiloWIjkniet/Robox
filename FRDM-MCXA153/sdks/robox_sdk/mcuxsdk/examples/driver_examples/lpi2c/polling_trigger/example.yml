      brief: The lpi2c_polling_trigger example shows how to use lpi2c driver to transfer
        using polling method with trigger signal:In this example, one lpi2c instance
        as master and another lpi2c instance on the same board as slave. Master sends
        a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received from slave is correct when there is a trigger
        signal.
