      brief: This example demonstrates how to use the LCDIF gamma correction feature.
        In this example, the gamma corretion table is set to invert the original picture.
        The original picture is gradual changed gray bars, the gamma correction is
        continuously enabled and disabled, so you can see the screen switch between
        the original picture and the inverted picture.
