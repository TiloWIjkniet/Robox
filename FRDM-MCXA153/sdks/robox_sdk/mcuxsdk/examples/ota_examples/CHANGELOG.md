### Added
- Added basic support for KW47-EVK and MCX-W72-EVK board
- Added SB3 processing support for MIMXRT700EVK (see [SB3 doc](_doc/sb3_common_readme.md))

## [25.09.0] - 09/2025

### Fixed

### Changed
- Update MCUboot to 2.2.0

    - PSA Crypto API (MCUBOOT_USE_PSA_CRYPTO) is used in default configurations to utilize hardware acceleration
    - Legacy API (MCUBOOT_USE_MBED_TLS) is used in configuration using Encrypted XIP due limitations in PSA Crypto API in current MCUboot version
